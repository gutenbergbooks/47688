<h3 class="no-break">JAPANESE GARDENS.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The Japanese garden is not a flower
garden, neither is it made for the
purpose of cultivating plants. In
nine cases out of ten there is nothing
in it resembling a flower-bed. Some gardens
may contain scarcely a sprig of green;
some (although these are exceptional) have
nothing green at all and consist entirely
of rocks, pebbles and sand. Neither does
the Japanese garden require any fixed
allowance of space; it may cover one or
many acres, it may be only ten feet square;
it may, in extreme cases, be much less,
and be contained in a curiously shaped,
shallow, carved box set in a veranda, in
which are created tiny hills, microscopic
ponds and rivulets spanned by tiny humped
bridges, while queer wee plants represent
trees, and curiously formed pebbles stand
for rocks. But on whatever scale, all true
Japanese gardening is landscape gardening;
that is to say, it is a living model of
an actual Japanese landscape.</p>

<p>But, though modelled upon an actual
landscape, the Japanese garden is far more
than a mere naturalistic imitation. To the
artist every natural view may be said to
convey, in its varying aspects, some particular
mental impression or mood, such
as the impression of peacefulness, of wildness,
of solitude, or of desolation; and the
Japanese gardener intends not only to
present in his model the features of the
veritable landscape, but also to make it
express, even more saliently than the original,
a dominant sentimental mood, so that
it may become not only a picture, but a
poem. In other words, a Japanese garden
of the best type is, like any true work of
art, the representation of nature as expressed
through an individual artistic
temperament.</p>

<p>Through long accumulation of traditional
methods, the representation of
natural features in a garden model has
come to be a highly conventional expression,
like all Japanese art; and the Japanese
garden bears somewhat the same relation
to an actual landscape that a painting of a
view of Fuji-yama by the wonderful Hokusai
does to the actual scene&mdash;it is a representation
based upon actual and natural
forms, but so modified to accord with accepted
canons of Japanese art, so full of
mysterious symbolism only to be understood
by the initiated, so expressed, in a
word, in terms of the national artistic
conventions, that it costs the Western
mind long study to learn to appreciate its
full beauty and significance. Suppose, to
take a specific example, that in the actual
landscape upon which the Japanese gardener
chose to model his design, a pine
tree grew upon the side of a hill. Upon
the side of the corresponding artificial hill
in his garden he would therefore plant a
pine, but he would not clip and trim its
branches to imitate the shape of the original,
but rather, satisfied that by so placing
it he had gone far enough toward the
imitation of nature, he would clip his
garden pine to make it correspond, as
closely as circumstances might permit,
with a conventional ideal pine tree shape
(such a typical ideal pine tree is shown in
the little drawing on page 25), a shape
recognized as the model for a beautiful
pine by the artistic conventions of Japan
for centuries, and one familiar to every
Japanese of any pretensions to culture
whatsoever. And, as there are recognized
ideal pine tree shapes, there are also ideal
mountain shapes, ideal lake shapes, ideal
water-fall shapes, ideal stone shapes, and
innumerable other such ideal shapes.</p>

<p>In like manner in working out his design
the gardener must take cognizance of a multitude
of religious and ethical conventions.
The flow of his streams must, for instance,
follow certain cardinal directions; in the
number and disposition of his principal
rocks he must symbolize the nine spirits
of the Buddhist pantheon. Some tree and
stone combinations are regarded as fortunate,
and should be introduced if possible;
while other combinations are considered
unlucky, and are to be as carefully avoided.</p>

<p>But endless and complex and bewildering
to the western mind as are the rules
and formulæ, æsthetic, symbolistic and
religious, by which the Japanese landscape
gardener is bound, it is apparent that
most of them were originally based upon
purely picturesque considerations, and that
the earliest practitioners of this very
ancient art, finding that certain types
of arrangement, certain contrasts of
mass or line, led to harmonious results,
formulated their discoveries into rules,
much as the rules of composition are formulated
for us today in modern artistic
treatises. Moreover, as Japanese gardening
was at first, and for many years, practised
only as a sacred art and by the priests
of certain religious cults, it was but
natural that they should impart to these
laws which they had discovered symbolic
and religious attributes. To preserve the
arts in their purity, and to prevent the
vulgar from transgressing æsthetic laws,
combinations productive of beauty were
represented as auspicious, and endowed
with moral significance, while inharmonious
arrangements were condemned as
unlucky or inauspicious. It is one of the
cardinal principles of Japanese philosophy,
for example, that the inanimate objects of
the universe are endowed with male or
female attributes, and that from a proper
blending of the two sex essences springs
all the harmony, good fortune and beauty
in this world. When, therefore, two contrasting
shapes, colors, or masses, such as
those of the sturdy pine tree and the
graceful willow, were found conducive of
a pleasing combination, they were named
respectively male and female, and it became
almost a religious observance to
thereafter place them together in their
attributed sex relations.</p>

<p>It will be apparent, therefore, that with
an art of such antiquity, originally practised
as a religious ceremony, and in a
country in which inherited tradition has
such binding force, that there should have
grown up around the craft of landscape
gardening, a code of the most complex
laws, rules, symbolism, formulæ and superstitions,
which the artistic gardener is
bound to learn and to implicitly obey.</p>

<p>And yet it must not be considered that
the art of the Japanese gardener has,
through the accumulation of its limiting
rules, become a mere science, or that its
practice is only a mechanical expression of
pre-established artistic conventions. On
the contrary, the landscape gardener must
be, first of all, a student and lover of
nature, for his art is founded on nature;
he must be next a poet, in order to appreciate
and re-express in his garden the
moods of nature, and he must thereafter be
a lifelong student of his craft, that he may
design in accordance with its established
principles. But the very number of these
precepts makes a wide range of choice
among them possible; and in almost every
instance, even the most apparently superstitious
and fanciful of them will be found,
upon examination, to make in some way for
beauty in the final result. To those who
can understand it, moreover, the mystical
symbolism of a Japanese garden design is
an added source of pleasure, just as a
knowledge of symphonic form makes a
symphony more enjoyable to the musician.</p>

<p>"After having learned," writes Mr.
Lafacdio Hearn, "something about the
Japanese manner of arranging flowers, one
can thereafter consider European ideas of
floral decoration only as vulgarities. Somewhat
in the same way, and for similar
reasons, after having learned what a Japanese
garden is, I can remember our costliest
and most elaborate gardens at home
only as ignorant displays of what wealth
can accomplish in the creation of incongruities
that violate nature."</p>

<p>The Japanese artist who is called upon
to design a new garden will first examine
the site, and confer with his patron regarding
its proposed size and character. If the
site be large, and already furnished with
natural hills, trees and water, the gardener
will, of course, take advantage of these
features. If it possess none of them, he will
inquire the amount of money that can be
placed at his disposal for the construction
of artificial hills, lakes and the like; and
this amount of money will also determine
another important point, namely, the degree
of elaboration with which the whole
is to be treated. For all works of Japanese
art whatsoever are rigorously divided into
three styles, the "rough" style, the "finished"
style and the "intermediate" style;
and the adoption of any one style governs
the degree of elaboration to which any part
of the design may be carried. If the
"rough" style is chosen, even the smallest
accessory detail&mdash;a rustic well, or a stone
lantern&mdash;must be rude to harmonize; if the
"finished" style, no detail that does not
correspond can be admitted,&mdash;a restriction
greatly conducive to harmony, and one to
which the almost invariable congruity and
unity of Japanese compositions is due.</p>

<p>Knowing, then, the size and character of
the site, and his patrons' wishes as to expense
and elaboration, the landscape gardener
will next choose the model landscape,
or landscapes, upon which he is to base
his design. He will find them divided by
convention into two classes: those representing
"Hill Gardens" and "Flat Gardens."
(There is a third class, the "Tea
Garden," but as this is of a separate genus
altogether, it will be considered later.)</p>

<p>Showing some important features of arrangement close to a dwelling,&mdash;the water basin with its rock-hidden
drain, the lantern, with its fire-box partially concealed by the trained branches of the pine tree.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Hill Garden" class is the more
elaborate of the two, and that best adapted
for large gardens, and for those where the
natural site is undulating, or where money
can be spent in artificial grading. The "Hill
Garden" has many different species, such,
for instance, as the "Rocky-ocean" style,
which represents in general an inlet of the
sea surrounded by high cliffs, the shores
spread with white sea-sand, scattered with
sea rocks and grown upon with pine trees
trained to look as if bent and distorted
with the sea wind; or the "Wide-river"
style, showing a spreading stream issuing
from behind a hill and running into a lake;
or the "Reed-marsh" style, in which the
hills are low, rounded sand dunes bordering
a heath or moor in which lies a marshy
pool overgrown with rushes; and many
other such "styles," all well recognized, all
carefully discriminated and all modelled
upon actual landscapes. In any case, however,
the true "Hill Garden" must present,
in combination, mountain or hill, and
water scenery.</p>

<p>If on the contrary the site be small and
flat, and the garden is to be less elaborate,
the "Flat" style is usually chosen. The
"Flat Garden" is generally supposed to
represent either the floor of a mountain
valley, a moor, a rural scene, or the like;
and as in the case of "Hill Gardens," there
are a number of well recognized and classical
examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Having, then, determined that the garden
is to be of one of these types, and having also
determined the degree of elaboration with
which it is to be treated, the gardener will
next proceed to fix the scale upon which it
is to be constructed,&mdash;and this scale (a
most important factor) is decided by the
size of the garden area, and the number of
features which must be introduced into the
scene; for it is clear that if the site be
large, and one in which natural hills or
large bodies of water are already present,
the scale will be a normal one; whereas if
a whole valley, with hills, a river, a water-fall,
a lake and a wooded slope is to be presented
in a space of some fifty or sixty
square yards, the scale of the whole must
be miniature. But whatever scale is
adopted, every tree, every rock, every pool,
every accessory detail must be made
exactly to correspond to it. A hill that
might in a large garden be a natural elevation
of considerable size, with full sized
trees planted upon it, might in a smaller
one modelled after the same design, be
only a hillock, planted with dwarfed trees
or shrubs; or in a still smaller area become
only a clump of thick-leaved bushes
trimmed to resemble a hill-shape, or even
a large boulder flanked by tiny shrubs. So
skilfully and completely do Japanese gardeners
carry out any scale that they have
determined upon, however, that Mr. Hearn
describes a garden of not much above thirty
yards square, that when viewed through
a window from which the garden alone was
visible, seemed to be really an actual and
natural landscape seen from a distance,&mdash;a
perfect illusion.</p>

<p>Having determined upon the natural
model and the scale for it, the gardener
will begin by imitating on the given site the
main natural land conformations of his
original, building hills or grading slopes,
excavating lake basins and cutting river
channels. These natural features he will
next proceed to elaborate, and it is in this
process of elaboration that he must most
carefully observe all those complex laws
and conventions to which we have before
alluded.</p>

<p>Showing some characteristic garden accessories,&mdash;stepping-stones, a lantern, a common variety of bamboo fence.
The lantern and plum tree conventionally mark the approach to a little shrine reached through a Shinto archway
by means of a row of stepping-stones.]</p>

<p>Almost every Japanese garden, be it
hilly or flat, large or small, rough or elaborate,
must be made to contain, in some
form, water, rocks and vegetation, as well
as such architectural accessories as bridges,
pagodas, lanterns, water-basins, stepping-stones
and boundary fences or hedges.</p>

<p>Water may be made to present the sea,
lakes, rivers, brooks, water-falls, springs,
or combinations of them. It is not, of
course, possible to imitate the open sea with
any degree of realism; and when a coast
scene is presented, it is customary to fashion
the body of water as an ocean inlet,
the supposed juncture with the sea being
hidden by a cliff or hill. Lake scenes are
much more common. There are six
"classical" shapes into which lake forms
are divided, some of them more formal for
use near buildings, others more natural
for use in wilder landscapes. It is an
axiom that every lake, or pool, or stream
represented must have both its source
and outlet indicated. Sometimes the
inflow is indicated by a stream issuing from
behind a hillock which conceals its artificial
source, sometimes a deep pool of
clear water may suggest a spring, sometimes
a water-fall (at least ten individual
and distinct forms of water-fall are recognized
as admissible into a properly planned
garden) supplies the water; but water
showing no inflow or outlet is termed
"dead" water, and is regarded with the
contempt bestowed upon all shams and
falsities in art.</p>

<p>In cases where it is impossible to introduce
actual water into a garden its presence
is often imitated by areas of smooth or
rippled sand, the banks of the sand bed
treated to simulate the banks of a natural
lake or stream, and islands and bridges
introduced to further the illusion.</p>

<p>Extreme importance is attached to the
use in gardens of natural stones, rocks and
boulders; and some teachers of the craft
go so far as to maintain that they constitute
the skeleton of the design, and
that their proper disposition and selection
should receive the primary consideration.
In large gardens there may be as many as
one hundred and thirty-eight principal
rocks and stones, each having its special
name and function; but in smaller ones as
few as five rocks will often suffice. Whatever
the style of landscape composition,
three stones, the "Guardian Stone," the
"Stone of Worship," and the "Stone of
the Two Deities" must never be dispensed
with, their absence being regarded as inauspicious.
On the same principle there are
certain stone forms which are considered
unlucky, and are therefore invariably
avoided.</p>

<p>The raised parts of a Japanese garden
are supposed to represent the nearer eminences
or distant mountains of natural
scenery, and the stones which adorn them
are intended to imitate either minor undulations
and peaks, or rocks or boulders on
their slopes. In like manner there are no
less than twenty "water" stones, which
have their places in lake and river scenery,
as well as nine varieties of "cascade" stones
alone. There are also sixteen stones which
have their functions solely in the adornment
of islands.</p>

<p>After the contours of land and water and
the principal rocks and stones have been
arranged, the distribution of garden vegetation
is considered; for the garden rocks
form only the skeleton of the design and
are only complete when embellished with
vegetation.</p>

<p>In the grounds of the larger temples,
avenues and groves of trees are planted
with the same formality adopted in Western
gardens, but in true landscape gardening
such formal arrangements are never resorted
to. Indeed it is an axiom that when
several trees are planted together they
should never be placed in rows, but always
in open and irregular groups. The rules
for planting the clumps are rigidly determined;
and these clumps may be disposed
in double, triple or quadruple combinations,
while these combinations may be again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>regrouped according to recognized rules
based upon contrasts of form, line and
color of foliage. Occasionally, when it is
the designer's purpose to represent a
natural forest or woodland, formulas are, of
course, disregarded, and the trees are
grouped together irregularly.</p>

<p>The architectural accessories of the
Japanese garden,&mdash;bridges, pagodas, lanterns,
water-basins, wells and boundary
fences or hedges, we have no space to consider
in detail. It must suffice to say that
their use is rather ornamental than to aid
in the landscape imitation, and that they
are generally placed in the foreground of
the scene. There are many beautiful designs
for each of them, and their use and
disposition is formally regulated.</p>

<p>Important accessories in the Japanese
garden are Stepping-Stones. Turf is not
used in the open spaces, but these are
spread with sand, either pounded smooth
or raked into elaborate patterns. This
sand, kept damp at all times, presents a
cool and fresh surface, and to preserve
its smoothness, which the marks of the
Japanese wooden clogs would sadly mar, a
pathway is invariably constructed across
such areas with stones called "stepping-stones,"
or "flying stones" as they are
occasionally termed, on account of the
supposed resemblance in their composition
to the order taken by a flight of birds. In
the simpler and smaller gardens such stones
form one of the principal features of the
design. As nothing could be less artistic
than a formal arrangement of stones at
regular intervals, not to speak of the difficulty
of keeping one's balance while walking
upon them, the Japanese gardener
therefore uses certain special stones and
combinations having definite shapes and
dimensions, the whole being arranged with
a studied irregularity. The sketch on this
page exhibits three typical arrangements.
The left hand group shows stepping-stones
as arranged to lead from a tea room. The
centre group shows stepping-stones combined
with a "pedestal stone" which marks
the point from which a typical cross view
in the garden is to be observed. The right
hand group shows the stones near a veranda
with a "shoe-removing" stone terminating
the series.</p>

<p>A third main type of garden, neither
"Flat" nor "Hilly," to which we have before
referred, properly speaking, is called
the "Tea Garden." "Tea Gardens" are
used for the performance of the "tea ceremony,"
and to explain the principle of its
design would require a preliminary explanation
of the intricacies of that ceremony
itself, to which an entire volume might
easily be devoted. A most cursory indication
of the principal use and requirements
must here suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<p>"Tea Gardens" are divided into outer
and inner inclosures separated by a rustic
fence. The outermost inclosure contains
a main entrance gate, and behind this there
is often a small building in which it is
sometimes the custom to change the
clothing before attending the ceremony.
The outer inclosure also contains a picturesque
open arbor, called the "Waiting
Shed," which plays an important part in
tea ceremonies, for here the guests adjourn
at stated intervals to allow of fresh
preparations being made in the tiny tea
room. The tea room is entered from the
garden through a low door, about two and
one-half feet square, placed in the outer
wall and raised two feet from the ground,
through which the guests are obliged to
pass in a bending posture indicative of
humility and respect. The rustic well
forms an important feature of the inner
garden, as do the principal lantern and the
water-basin. A portion of the inner inclosure
of a "Tea Garden" in the Tamagawa,
or Winding-river style, showing the
stream, bridge, lantern, water-basin, and
an arrangement of stones, including the
indispensable "Guardian Stone," is represented
in the drawing on this page. All
these separate features are connected,
according to very rigid principles, by stepping-stones
which make meandering routes
between them, and form the skeleton of
the whole design.</p>

<p>We can, perhaps, no better summarize
this necessarily sketchy review of a complex
subject, than by reproducing here,
from Professor Conder's very elaborate
monograph, "Landscape Gardening in
Japan," (Tokio, 1893)&mdash;from which most
of the information in this article has been
derived, and to which the student of the
subject is referred,&mdash;a figured model of
an ordinary "Hill Garden" in the finished
style. The numbers refer to the titles of
the principal hills, stones, tree clumps and
accessories, the positions of which are all
relatively established by rule.</p>

<p>Hill 1 represents a mountain of considerable
size in the middle distance, in front
of which should be placed the cascade
which feeds the lake; while Hills 2 and 3
are its companions, the depressions between
them being planted with shrubs
giving the idea of a sheltered dale. Hill 5
represents a distant peak in the perspective.</p>

<p>The model shows ten important stones.
The "Guardian Stone," 1, representing
the dedication stone of the garden, occupies
the most central position in the background,
and in this case forms the flank of
the cliff over which the cascade pours. The
broad flat "Worshipping Stone," 3, indicating
the place for worship, is placed in
the foreground, or some open space. The
"Moon-Shadow Stone," 6, occupies an
important position in the distant hollow
between two hills and in front of the
distant peak, its name implying the sense
of indistinctness and mystery attached to it.</p>

<p>The term "tree" as used in the diagram
often refers to an arrangement or clump
of trees. The "Principal Tree," 1, is
placed in the centre of the background,
and is usually a large and striking specimen.
The "View Perfecting Tree," 2,
generally stands alone, and its shape is
carefully trained to harmonize with the
foreground accessories. The "Tree of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Solitude," 3, is a group to afford a shady
resting place. The "Tree of the Setting
Sun," 5, is planted in the western part of
the garden to intercept the direct rays of
the sunset. The titles of the other features
in the model will probably be found self
explanatory.</p>
